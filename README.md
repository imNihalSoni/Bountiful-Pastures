# Bountiful Pastures - Fresh Farm Produce Delivery App
Bountiful Pastures is a web application that enables users to order fresh farm produce and have it delivered to their doorstep. It is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) along with Redux for state management. The frontend design template used in the project is sourced from Creative Tim's open-source library.

## Features

- User Authentication and Authorization
- Users can register an account, login, and logout.
- User passwords are securely hashed and stored in the database.
- JWT (JSON Web Token) is used for user authentication.
- Protected routes ensure that only authenticated users can access certain pages.
- Product Catalog and Ordering
- The product catalog displays a variety of fresh farm produce available for purchase.
- Users can view product details, such as name, description, price, and quantity available.
- Products can be added to a shopping cart for later checkout.
- Users can place orders for the selected products.
- Cart and Checkout
- Users can add or remove products from their cart.
- The cart displays the selected products, quantities, and total price.
- Users can proceed to the checkout page to finalize their order.
- The checkout page collects user information, delivery address, and payment details.
- Order confirmation and status updates are provided to the user

## Backend Architecture
 The backend of the Bountiful Pastures app is built using Node.js and Express.js. It follows a modular architecture with the following components:

### Schemas
1. User Schema: Stores user information including name, email, password, and role.
2. Product Schema: Represents the farm produce available for purchase with details like name, description, price, and quantity.
3. Order Schema: Stores information about the user's orders, including the products, quantities, and delivery details.

### Routes
1. User Routes: Handles user-related operations such as registration, login, logout, and profile updates.
2. Product Routes: Manages CRUD operations for products, including fetching, creation, and updating.
3. Order Routes: Handles placing orders, fetching order history, and updating order status.

### Controllers
1. User Controller: Implements the logic for user-related operations, including authentication, registration, and profile updates.
2. Product Controller: Implements the logic for product-related operations, such as fetching products and updating quantities.
3. Order Controller: Implements the logic for order-related operations, including placing orders and updating order status.

### Middleware
1. Authentication Middleware: Verifies the user's JWT token to authenticate protected routes.
2. Error Middleware: Checks the all types of errors generated by backend service and handles the database and servers accordingly.

### Database
1. MongoDB is used as the database to store user information, product details, and order history.
2. Mongoose is used as the ODM (Object-Document Mapping) library for MongoDB, providing a convenient way to interact with the database.
3. JWT Tokens and Cookies
   - JWT (JSON Web Token) is used for user authentication and authorization.
   - When a user logs in, a JWT token is generated and stored as an HTTP-only cookie.
   - The token is sent with each authenticated request to verify the user's identity and authorization.

## Frontend Design and UI Components
The frontend of the Bountiful Pastures app is built using React.js and utilizes a design template from Creative Tim's open-source library. The design template provides a clean and modern UI with responsive components and layouts. The UI components are customized and integrated with the app's functionality to provide a seamless user experience.

To get started with the Bountiful Pastures app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install` in the project root directory.
